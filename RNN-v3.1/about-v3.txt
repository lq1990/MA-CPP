in version1:
	map<string, MyStruct> is used to store data "dataSScaling.mat" from Matlab.
	map, a kind of data structure, is not convenient to do index and shuffle operations.

in version2:
	vector<MyStruct> is used to store data "listStructTrain.mat" from Matlab.

in versin3:
	naive RNN => LSTM
	CPU & GPU Parallel Computing
		About GPU: CUDA libs (thrust, cuBLAS)
